### Merge Sorted Array 0001

The problem is LeetCode 88. Merge Sorted Array. The goal is to merge two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2 into a single sorted array in non-decreasing order. The merged array should be stored in nums1, which has a size large enough to hold the additional elements from nums2.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

Understand the Problem:

You have two sorted arrays.
nums1 has a sufficient size to hold the additional elements from nums2.
You need to modify nums1 in place to be the merged sorted array.
Initial Thoughts:

Since nums1 has enough space to hold the elements of both arrays, we can fill nums1 from the end to start to avoid overwriting elements that have not been checked.
Utilize the given lengths of the actual elements (m for nums1 and n for nums2) to only work with the relevant parts of the arrays.
Algorithm:

Start from the last index of nums1 and nums2 based on their given sizes (m and n).
Compare the elements at these indices and place the larger one at the end of nums1.
Decrement the index from where the larger element was taken.
Repeat the process until all elements from nums2 are merged into nums1.
If there are remaining elements in nums2 that are smaller than all elements in nums1, copy them over.
Coding the Solution:

Initialize three pointers: i set to m - 1, j set to n - 1, and k set to m + n - 1.
While j is greater than or equal to 0:
If i is less than 0 or nums2[j] is greater than nums1[i], place nums2[j] in nums1[k], and decrement j and k.
Else, copy nums1[i] to nums1[k], and decrement i and k.
If i runs out before j, copy the remaining elements from nums2 to nums1.
Implementation:

Here's how you could implement this in Python:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
i, j, k = m-1, n-1, m+n-1

        while j >= 0:
            if i < 0 or nums2[j] > nums1[i]:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                j -= 1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                i -= 1
            k -= 1

        # This step is not necessary as Python's list assignment will overwrite
        # the elements, and since we are merging into nums1, any remaining elements
        # in nums1 are already in their correct position.

This code will modify nums1 in-place to contain the merged sorted array. It runs in O(n + m) time, where n and m are the lengths of nums2 and nums1, respectively. This satisfies the problem's requirement to achieve O(n + m) time complexity.
